            Globally, bowling is a $10 billion a year industry. It is an affordable sport enjoyed by young and old alike, 
            and is said to be largely recession-proof. It's no wonder, then, that many entrepreneurs consider the possibility 
            of opening a bowling alley. If you are considering starting a bowling business, you should be aware that the initial 
            cost can be significant, although bowling alleys also offer multiple profit centers. While going independent is 
            certainly an option, many people opt to buy into a bowling franchise.
